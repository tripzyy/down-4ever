### ‚úî Getting Started
</div>
</p>

**Proxies**:
To start using down-4ever, you need to get proxies. You can gain from this even with shit proxies, but the payout will be lower. Up-4ever pays 7$ USD/1000 Downloads on USA/Canada IPs, so before starting please note that premium US/canada proxies will work significantly better and give you a higher payout.

**VPS (optional)**:
You may want to rent a VPS or private server to run down-4ever. While our software is heavily optimized and can work great on even the lowest spec hardware, you will notice the difference day-and-night from a PC and a VPS running our codes. We sincerely recommend Digitalocean if you choose to do this, for just $5 you can run our code much faster and obviously it can make it back to you.

**Program Setup**:
Setting up down-4ever is ever so easy, just follow the steps below.

1. Download the repository release. Just go to releases and download the zip file.
2. Extract the zip file and run `python3 down-4ever.py` on your pc. Requires Python 3+.
3. The file will start and walk you through the process of flooding your url. If you would like, you can take a look at the code and see how it was made.

### ‚Åâ FAQ

**How does your program work**?
You can feel free to look at the code to see how down-4ever works and is heavily optimized for you. Down-4ever utilizes online privacy tools like proxies to spam Paid-2-Download links and not actually download the file, while counting as a successful download in the Up-4ever database.

**Do you plan on expanding to other P2D sites**?
Yes. At the moment we only support Up-4ever. In the future we plan to add support for bypassing countless other Paid Download sites, opening up more opportunities for different people anywhere in the world to utilize this amazing tool.

**How can I contact you, tripzyy**?
