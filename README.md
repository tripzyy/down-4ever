### ✔ Getting Started
</div>
</p>

**Proxies**:
To start using down-4ever, you need to get proxies. You can gain from this even with shit proxies, but the payout will be lower. Up-4ever pays 7$ USD/1000 Downloads on USA/Canada IPs, so before starting please note that premium US/canada proxies will work significantly better and give you a higher payout.

**Program Setup**:
Setting up down-4ever is ever so easy, just follow the steps below.

1. Download the repository release. Just go to releases and download the zip file, then extract it.
2. Open `config.json.example` in Notepad and fill in the right side of the json file where you are told to.
3. Save the file and rename it to `config.json`.
4. Run `python3 down-4ever.py` on your pc. Requires Python 3+.
5. The file will start and walk you through the process of flooding your url. If you would like, you can take a look at the code and see how it was made.
